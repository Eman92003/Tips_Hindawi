# 🤖 LLM & Generative AI Internship Projects  
**TIPS Hindawi Internship**

This repository contains the work completed during my internship at **TIPS Hindawi**, where we explored **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** , **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative AI** through hands-on, progressive weekly projects.

The internship focused on building a **strong practical understanding**, starting from basic NLP tasks and ending with **optimized models and a complete interactive interface**.

## 🗓️ Weekly Breakdown

### 🔹 Week 2 – Text Summarization
In this phase, we started with the fundamentals of NLP using **pre-trained transformer models**.

**What we did:**
- Implemented text summarization using Hugging Face models
- Worked with inference only (no training)
- Applied text preprocessing
- Controlled summary length and quality

**Key Takeaway:**  
Using powerful NLP models directly for fast and effective results.

### 🔹 Week 3 – Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This week focused on combining **information retrieval** with **language generation**.

**What we did:**
- Built a RAG pipeline
- Retrieved relevant documents based on user queries
- Injected retrieved context into the LLM
- Improved answer accuracy and reduced hallucinations

**Key Concepts:**
- Embeddings
- Vector similarity search
- Context-aware generation

---

### 🔹 Week 4 – LangChain, Chains & Output Parsers

This phase focused on building **structured LLM pipelines**.

**What we did:**
- Used LangChain to manage LLM workflows
- Built Chains to connect multiple steps
- Applied Output Parsers to extract structured JSON
- Designed prompts for structured information extraction

**Key Takeaway:**  
Converting unstructured LLM outputs into reliable structured data.

### 🔹 Week 5 – Quantization, Fine-Tuning & Deployment

The final and most advanced phase of the internship.

**What we did:**
- Applied model quantization (4-bit / 8-bit)
- Learned fine-tuning fundamentals
- Optimized models for performance and memory
- Used Ngrok to expose local APIs
- Built an interactive Streamlit interface

**Final Outcome:**  
A complete end-to-end NLP system with:
- Optimized models  
- Backend APIs  
- User-friendly web interface
